<h1>üë©‚Äçüíª My Journey</h1>

<p>My love for coding started from my love for reading. I've always loved reading science fiction and fantasy with good world building - that got me hooked on complex systems early on. So, when I first encountered coding at the age of 14, it felt just as magical - you take a machine that can understand only 0s and 1s and use it to build such useful systems. I still feel that fascination when I immerse myself in a complex domain and do the world building in my mind!</p>

<p>I studied Computer Science in India and began my career at Cisco in Bangalore, where I spent five years working on the operating system powering Internet Backbone routers ‚Äî high-performance, low-level systems in C and C++. That‚Äôs where I learned to think in data structures and build with precision.</p>

<p>I moved to the US in 2018 - to New York City. I joined Bloomberg at a time when they were modernising their systems from C++ and bare metal, to Python and their private cloud. I worked there for 2 years and built a solid understanding of microservices.</p>

<p>Next came four impactful years at Lyft, where I grew from owning a small Places service to leading much of the mapping stack (excluding navigation). I built systems that optimized real-world pickups and routing‚Äîdelivering better rider experiences at scale.</p>

<p>In 2023, as foundation models began transforming the landscape, I joined Meta‚Äôs AI Infrastructure team to dive deep into the world of AI systems. I built tools to optimize GPU memory usage, reduce training failures, and improve inference throughput for models like Llama3.</p>

<p>Now, I‚Äôm ready for my next chapter: joining a mission-driven AI startup where I can move fast, solve hard problems, and keep building magical, world-changing systems.</p>
