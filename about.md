<h1>üë©‚Äçüíª My Journey</h1>

<p><strong>My love for coding started with my love for reading.</strong> I‚Äôve always been drawn to science fiction and fantasy‚Äîstories with rich world-building and complex systems. When I wrote my first program at age 14, it felt just as magical: turning a machine that understands only 0s and 1s into something alive and useful. That feeling still drives me today, especially when diving into a complex domain and mentally mapping out the systems behind it.</p>

<p>I studied Computer Science in India and began my career at <strong>Cisco Systems</strong> in Bangalore. I spent five years working on the OS for internet backbone routers, <em>high-performance, low-level systems built in C and C++</em>. That‚Äôs where I learned to think in data structures, build for performance, and develop systems with precision.</p>

<p>In 2018, I moved to New York City and joined <strong>Bloomberg</strong> as they were modernizing their infrastructure. I spent two years helping transition from bare-metal C++ systems to cloud-native services in Python, and deepened my understanding of distributed systems and microservices.</p>

<p>After that, I joined <strong>Lyft</strong>, where I spent four years working on the Mapping team. I started by owning a small service called Places, and eventually led most of the mapping stack (excluding navigation). I built systems that optimized pickup and dropoff locations, improved real-world routing, and delivered better rider and driver experiences at scale.</p>

<p>In 2023, as foundation models began reshaping the AI landscape, I joined <strong>Meta‚Äôs AI Infrastructure</strong> team to focus on performance and efficiency of large-scale training and inference systems. That experience helped me deeply understand the systems behind modern AI, and how to make them faster, cheaper, and more reliable.</p>

<p><strong>Now, I‚Äôm ready for the next chapter:</strong> joining a mission-driven AI startup where I can move fast, solve hard infrastructure problems, and keep building systems that feel just a little bit magical.</p>
